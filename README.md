### ðŸ“š Incremental Kata - no peeping ahead!

This is an **incremental kata** to simulate a real business situation: work your way through the steps in order, but **do not read the next requirement** before you have finished your current one.

### ðŸ‘¥ Your Team

Is tired of all those boring tasks like bowling game scores, bank accounts, singing songs or commanding mars rovers. This time you want to do something truly innovative: **A Social Network!**

### ðŸ“‹ Your Rules

Your team also decided for this project to not only apply **TDD** and **pair-programming** - this time you're gonna use **BDD** to cover all important features.
